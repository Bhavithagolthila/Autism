Early Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder 

Early Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder is a web-based tool designed to help parents identify early behavioral signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children. The system allows parents to create an account, enter their child’s information, and complete an interactive behavioral questionnaire. Based on the responses, the system calculates the likelihood of autism, classifies the severity as Mild, Moderate, or Severe, and provides personalized activity recommendations to support child development. If no symptoms are observed, parents are redirected to a Thank You page, ensuring a smooth user experience.

The tool features a user-friendly interface that is accessible and easy to navigate. Parents can quickly answer questions about their child’s behavior, and the system processes the responses using custom logic to generate accurate results. The results include an autism likelihood percentage, severity classification, and tailored activity suggestions, helping parents take early and informed steps for their child’s growth.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js (Express) for the backend, and SQLite as the database. It can be hosted on a local server or GitHub Pages, making it easily deployable and accessible for parents seeking early detection tools.
